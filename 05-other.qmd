## Notes on shared software

### Using GitHub

Git is a version control system that can be used to synchronize files between the web and local directories. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a user-friendly website which hosts files and depends on Git.

### Shared code locations

Most of the R packages and code used in NWFSC assessments are listed in the README at (https://github.com/pfmc-assessments). Other sources not included in this github organization include [Stock Synthesis](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis) and associated packages including [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/) and [{ss3diags}](https://github.com/jabbamodel/ss3diags) (not yet used for PFMC assessments).

In addition, [NMFS OpenSci](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-opensci/repositories) has a number of NMFS templates for websites, quarto, Rmd docs, and presentations
